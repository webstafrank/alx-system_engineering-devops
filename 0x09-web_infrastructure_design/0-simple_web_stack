Designing a One-Server Web Infrastructure with a LAMP Stack
User accesses the browser and types “www.foobar.com”
DNS translates the http:www.foobar.com to an ip address which the browser then sends a request for.
Server handling the request - the server with the requested ip address receives the request.
The web server (Nginx) listens for the request on either HTTP or HTTPS. Upon processing the request, it sends it to the application server.
 The application server executes the logic in the application code and it can send queries to the database if any.
MySql stores or retrieves data as requested by the application server. The application server processes the data and gives a response.
The application server sends the response to the web server and the web server returns a website.

Notes:
Server - A physical or virtual machine that hosts all the components (web server, application server, database).

Domain names provide a human readable name that is easy for users.

Single Point of Failure (SPOF)- The entire website depends on a single server. If it fails, the website becomes unavailable.
Deploying new code or restarting the web server can cause downtime since there is no redundancy
